## BAIclaw Introduction

**BAIclaw** is a personal AI agent application built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) and [ClawX](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX/blob/main/README.md). BAIclaw inherits the core capabilities of OpenClaw while providing users with an out-of-the-box experience and graphical user interface.

For more tips and tricks, refer to the [OpenClaw Documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/).

## Core Features

### 🎯 Out-of-the-Box

Complete all configurations from installation to conversation entirely through the graphical user interface (GUI), with no need to execute terminal commands or manually write configuration files.

### 💬 Smart Interaction Interface

- **Immersive Experience:** Supports multi-session context management, history retention, and Markdown rich text rendering.
- **Agent Direct Routing:** Supports precise routing via the `@agent` command in the main input box. After switching, you'll directly enter the target Agent's independent conversation context, rather than being forwarded through the default Agent.

### 📡 Channel Management

- **Independent Operation:** Supports configuring multiple independently running AI channels to adapt to specific task flows.
- **Account Binding:** Each channel supports multi-account management. Users can complete Agent account binding and default account switching directly on the Channels page.

### ⏰ Automated Scheduling

Customizable triggers and time intervals, combined with preset scheduled tasks, enable AI Agents to perform 7×24 hour uninterrupted automated execution.

### 🧩 Skill Extension System

- **No Package Manager Required:** Built-in integrated skill panel, supporting skill browsing, installation, and management.
- **Pre-installed Skills:** Automatically deploys document processing skills (PDF, XLSX, DOCX, PPTX) and common search skills to the managed directory (default `~/.openclaw/skills`) on startup.
- **Source Tracking:** Automatically identifies and displays skill sources from the managed directory, workspace, and additional directories, supporting direct navigation to the skill's physical installation path.

### ⚙️ System Settings

- **Adaptive Theme:** Supports light, dark mode, or follows system global settings.
- **Auto-start on Boot:** Supports configuring automatic startup after system login in 【Settings → General】.
