# Get API Key

To use BAIclaw, you need an API Key from BAI. This key authenticates your requests and grants access to the large language model capabilities.

## What You Need

- A BAI account (free to register)

## Step 1: Log in to BAI

1. Open your browser and navigate to [BAI](https://chat.bankofai.io/chat)
2. Sign in with your existing account, or register a new one if you don't have it

## Step 2: Create an API Key

1. Look for the **API** section in the left sidebar
2. Click on it to open the API management page
3. Click the **Create API Key** button
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "BAIclaw Desktop")
5. Copy the generated key immediately — it will only be shown once

## Step 3: Configure in BAIclaw

1. Open BAIclaw and navigate to the **Models** page
2. Paste your copied API Key into the BAI API Key field
3. Click **Save** or **Verify** to confirm the connection

:::danger[Security Warning]
**Keep your API Key safe at all times:**
- The API Key is a critical credential for accessing the BAI model interface. Never share it with third parties.
- If leaked, unauthorized parties may consume your quota, resulting in unexpected charges. The account holder is responsible for any losses incurred.
- If you suspect your API Key has been compromised, delete it immediately in the BAI console, create a new one, and update the key in BAIclaw.

## Verification

To verify your API Key is working:

1. Go to the **Chat** page in BAIclaw
2. Send a simple test message (e.g., "Hello")
3. If you receive a response, your API Key is configured correctly

:::tip[Connection Issues?]
If you encounter errors when testing:
- Double-check that the API Key was copied completely (no extra spaces)
- Ensure your network connection is stable
- Verify your BAI account has available quota
